# Scan Requests Role-Based Access Control Update

## Problem Addressed
Previously, doctors could only see scan requests that were specifically assigned to them, limiting their ability to see all available requests in the system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Front-end Changes
- Updated the main scan requests page (`app/scan-requests/page.tsx`) to:
  - Use the `useUserRole` hook for consistent role checking
  - Allow doctors and admins to see all scan requests
  - Filter scan requests only for patients (showing them only their own requests)
  - Added a visual indicator for doctors/admins showing they're viewing all system requests

### 2. Database-level Changes
- Updated Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to:
  - Allow doctors and admins to view all scan requests (not just assigned ones)
  - Maintain appropriate access control for other operations

### 3. Role Helper Functions
- Created role helper functions in `lib/auth/role-helpers.ts` for cleaner code and better maintainability:
  - `isAdmin(role)` - Check if user has admin role
  - `isDoctor(role)` - Check if user has doctor role
  - `isPatient(role)` - Check if user has patient role
  - `isAdminOrDoctor(role)` - Check if user has either admin or doctor role

### 4. Related Pages Updates
- Updated "My Requests" page to use role helpers and consistent role checking
- Updated the scan request detail page to use role helpers and consistent role checking

## How to Apply Changes
1. Deploy the front-end code changes
2. Run the database policy update script:
   ```
   cd scripts
   .\run-update-scan-request-policies.bat
   ```

## Expected Outcome
- Patients: Continue to see only their own scan requests
- Doctors: Now see ALL scan requests in the system (not just assigned ones)
- Admins: Continue to see all scan requests (no change)

The "My Requests" page behavior remains unchanged - doctors will still only see requests assigned to them on that specific page.
